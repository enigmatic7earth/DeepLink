The deeplinks we are going to handle will have the following format:

deeplinkTutorial://messages/1
deeplinkTutorial://request/1

Copy and save this URLs in “Notes” on your testing device. If you tap on any of the links, nothing is going to happen.

If this was a Universal Link, tapping on the link would open a browser with a link URL.

Next clone/download the repo and run it on your testing device.
